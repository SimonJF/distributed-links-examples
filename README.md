# Distributed Links Examples

This repository contains various examples of distributed applications in
Links.

  * `agario` is a multiplayer implementation of the Agar.io game.
  * `calculator` is a minimal implementation of a calculator application
    with a shared memory cell. This is a fairly minimal example, so is a
    good place to start.
  * `chatserver` is the chat server example described in "Session Types
    without Tiers".
  * `extended_chatserver` is an extended version of the chatserver, with
    support for multiple rooms and moderators.
  * `pingpong` is a simple application demonstrating client->client
    communication.
  * `two-factor` is a two-factor authentication workflow.
